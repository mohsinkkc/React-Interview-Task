# React Interview Task - Starter Project

This repository is a ready-to-run starter implementation for the interview task you provided.
It includes:
- React + Vite setup
- Redux Toolkit store (auth + products)
- Login/Register (auth using dummyjson)
- Products list page (fetches from dummyjson)
- CRUD page with add/update/delete (using dummyjson endpoints)

## How to run

1. Extract the project folder.
2. In terminal, run:
   ```bash
   cd react-interview-task
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes

- The app stores the JWT token from dummyjson in `localStorage` after login.
- DummyJSON is a demo API; some endpoints (like register) are simulated in this starter code.
- You'll need Node.js and npm installed locally.

Good luck — feel free to ask for enhancements or explanations of any part of the code.
